# LD25 - Joe, the bad jack

This is a game prototype created during a weekend for the 
[Ludum Dare 25 game jam](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=18522) (please note those links
aren't available anymore). You can see a little bit about it's evolution at 
   [http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/sletari/]

The theme of this game jam was "You are the Villain". In the game you play as Joe, a lumberjack that kills trees
just for fun. Bad, bad joe.

If you want to try it out, give it a go at [http://jhcp.github.io/LD25/] (it's a HTML5 browser game, no 
installation required).

## Dependencies
[CraftyJS 0.5.3](https://craftyjs.com/) - Javascript Game library. Please note that I needed to change the
library's source code in order to fix a keyboard issue without updating to newer versions of the library.

## Credits
Game design, programming, music and graphics py Jo√£o Pimentel (jhcp). Sound effects created with
